Intro into what data structures are. The data structure demonstrated here is a single-linked list, a data structure in which its nodes have a value and a link
that points to the next node. Every new node created becomes the head of the list. The last node is considered the tail. The program driver populates the data
structure using add methods. It can also remove the latest node and search for nodes within the data structure. Each node has a to string that prints the value
and the node that it is linked to. The entire list can be printed out.

This project was done with the class. My teacher walked us through the whole thing.
